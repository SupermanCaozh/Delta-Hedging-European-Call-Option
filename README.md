# Delta-Hedging-European-Call-Option
This is an implementation of Delta Hedging on a case of European Call Option with underlying of The Walt Disney Company stock

## Task Description
Suppose you are a trader working on a bank’s option trading desk. A customer comes to you with the belief that the price of The Walt Disney Company stock (NYSE : DIS), we denote it S, will have increased above USD100 in one year. She wants to buy a call option to profit off of that. You need to price the call option while analysing quantitatively the impacts of different parameters and design a replication strategy to hedge the deals, within your firm’s risk management requirements.

## Parameter settings
In this version, we consider the essential parameters as follows.
1) Suppose that the starting price S0 is the current value of DIS.
2) Estimate volatility from 10 years of historic data to price the options.
3) Consider TTM=1y by default.
4) Consider a risk-free rate of r = 4% (10Y U.S. Treasury Bonds)
Please feel free to modify them if you would like to. The results would change consequently.
